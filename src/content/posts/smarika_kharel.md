# A Day in the Life: Understanding Autism Through Smarika Kharel’s Story

**Introduction**

Imagine starting each day with hope and determination, despite knowing that even simple routines might bring unexpected challenges. This is the reality for Suman Kharel and Situ Rimal, parents to Smarika, a young girl diagnosed with Rett syndrome. Smarika’s journey began with confusion and frustration, as her parents struggled to understand what was wrong with their child.
<br>

Like many parents in Nepal, Situ and Suman didn’t know what was causing Smarika’s difficulties. She couldn’t speak, walk, or use her hands like other children. It wasn’t until they reached out to specialists outside of Nepal that they learned Smarika had Rett syndrome. This rare neurodevelopmental disorder, often mistaken for autism, leads to a loss of previously acquired skills and motor abilities.

**Morning: A World of Silent Communication**

For Smarika, mornings begin with her parents guiding her through routines like dressing and breakfast. While verbal communication is difficult due to Rett syndrome, her parents have mastered the art of understanding her gestures and expressions.

"Her eyes speak volumes," says Situ, recalling how Smarika conveys her needs with a glance or a smile. This silent language strengthens their bond and teaches them to cherish the small victories—like a warm smile or a moment of calm.

**Midday: Therapy and Exploration**

Midday often involves therapy sessions tailored to Smarika’s needs. These sessions focus on improving motor skills, sensory integration, and communication techniques. In Nepal, access to specialized therapy remains limited, and many families, including Smarika’s, face challenges in finding consistent support.

Despite these hurdles, her parents remain determined. They believe that every therapy session, no matter how incremental the progress, is a step toward a better future for Smarika.

**Evening: Family and Reflection**

Evenings in the Kharel household are filled with love and reflection. Whether it’s listening to music or spending time as a family, they make the most of every moment together. Music, a universal language, has a calming effect on Smarika and brings joy to their home.

Her parents also use this time to reflect on their journey—how far they’ve come and the battles they continue to fight, not just for Smarika but for broader awareness of Rett syndrome and neurodiversity in Nepal.

**The Lessons Smarika Teaches Us**

Smarika’s story isn’t just about challenges; it’s about the lessons she teaches those around her. Her resilience and ability to find joy in the little things inspire everyone she meets. Her parents emphasize the importance of early intervention, awareness, and creating an inclusive society where neurodiverse individuals are valued and supported.

**A Call for Change**

Stories like Smarika’s are a wake-up call for all of us. Nepal’s journey toward inclusivity and support for neurodiverse individuals is still in its early stages. Families like the Kharels remind us of the urgent need for accessible resources, better healthcare, and increased awareness about conditions like Rett syndrome.

As we share their journey, let us commit to creating a world where children like Smarika can thrive—not despite their differences but because of them.
