## Introduction  
Did you know that the way autism is understood around the world is influenced by something called the ICD? If you’re unfamiliar with it, no worries! The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the global system doctors use to diagnose and track various conditions, including autism. But how does this technical tool shape our perceptions and treatment of autism? In this article, we’ll explore the fascinating evolution of autism within the ICD and how it’s impacted the way we understand and support individuals with autism.

## The ICD's Journey with Autism: From the Dark Ages to Today  
Let’s rewind a bit. Imagine the 1980s. Autism was often misunderstood, with children who were “different” being categorized in ways that didn’t reflect the full spectrum of the condition. As we move forward, we can see how the ICD’s relationship with autism evolved over time.

### ICD-9  
Autism was classified under "Other Childhood Psychoses," which didn’t quite capture the reality of the condition. This outdated approach meant many individuals with autism weren’t receiving the support they truly needed.

### ICD-10  
With the release of ICD-10, things began to improve. Autism was officially recognized as part of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), a step in the right direction, but it still didn’t fully reflect the variety of experiences within the autism spectrum.

### ICD-11  
Enter the ICD-11, the most recent version. It recognizes autism as part of a broad spectrum, reflecting the diversity of experiences within the condition. The ICD-11 is a game-changer, focusing on individual needs rather than fitting people into rigid categories.

## Why Does the ICD Matter?  
Let’s make it personal. How does the ICD impact someone diagnosed with autism?

### Diagnosis  
With clear definitions, doctors can diagnose autism more accurately, ensuring people get the right support and services.

### Access to Services  
The ICD classification is the key to unlocking essential services like therapy, educational support, and even insurance coverage. Without this classification, access could be significantly limited.

### Global Connection  
One of the coolest parts about the ICD is its ability to unify the world. Whether you’re in Nepal, the US, or anywhere else, doctors and researchers use the ICD to share information about autism, creating a common language that helps improve global understanding and treatment.
