The way autism is defined and diagnosed has a deep influence on how individuals are supported, accepted, and understood. With the release of the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), we have entered a new chapter—one that brings clarity, inclusivity, and a more human-centered understanding of autism.

## A Shift from Labels to Spectrum

In the previous version, ICD-10, autism was categorized under various separate labels like childhood autism, atypical autism, Asperger’s syndrome, and other pervasive developmental disorders. While this approach aimed to reflect the diversity within autism, it often caused confusion. People who clearly needed support sometimes didn’t "fit" into any of the given categories and were left undiagnosed—or misdiagnosed.

ICD-11 takes a different approach. Instead of splitting autism into separate conditions, it brings them all under a single term: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This change reflects what many autistic individuals, families, and professionals have long known—that autism exists on a spectrum, and every person experiences it in their own unique way.

## What Does ICD-11 Say About Autism?

In ICD-11, the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder is based on two key areas:

- Persistent differences in how a person communicates and interacts socially
- Repetitive behaviors, strong interests, routines, or sensory sensitivities

But it doesn’t stop there. The diagnosis also considers how these differences affect daily life—whether at home, school, work, or in relationships. This makes the criteria more realistic and practical, focusing on actual lived experience rather than just checklists.

ICD-11 also allows for helpful details to be added, such as whether the person has an intellectual disability or language difficulties. These additions don’t define the person but help tailor support to their specific needs.

## Why This Change Matters

Bringing all forms of autism under one spectrum is more than a technical adjustment—it’s a compassionate shift. Here’s why it matters:

- It simplifies the diagnostic process, making it easier for professionals to identify autism and offer support early.
- It acknowledges the full range of autistic experiences, whether someone needs substantial daily support or lives independently.
- It helps reduce stigma, since people are no longer boxed into rigid categories that might carry outdated or misleading meanings.
- It focuses on the person, not just the label—reminding us that support should be based on real-world challenges, not just how someone scores on a form.

## Moving Forward, Together

ICD-11 is a step forward in making autism diagnosis more fair, inclusive, and meaningful. But it’s just one piece of the puzzle. The way we talk about autism, how services are provided, and the level of awareness in communities all play a role in shaping the lives of autistic people.

What matters most is that we continue listening, learning, and building systems that see the person first—not just the diagnosis.

As we move into this new era, ICD-11 encourages us to embrace the spectrum—not as something to be feared or fixed, but as a part of human diversity that deserves understanding, respect, and support.
