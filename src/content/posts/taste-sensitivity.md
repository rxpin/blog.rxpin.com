The café was warm and cozy, filled with the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the sound of soft jazz playing in the background. I was sitting across from Aayush, a bright-eyed young adult with autism who agreed to meet me for coffee. We’d just ordered, and I noticed Aayush looking at the menu, hesitating.

When our orders arrived, I had a slice of chocolate cake, while Aayush chose a simple plate of toast. As I dug into my dessert, I couldn’t help but notice that Aayush didn’t touch his toast.

**“Is everything okay with the food?”** I asked.

Aayush offered a small smile. **“It’s fine. I just… don’t do well with certain tastes. Sometimes flavors feel way too strong, and the textures don’t sit right with me.”**

This simple response opened up a whole new understanding for me. As Aayush explained, I began to realize that his experience with food went far beyond personal preference—it was an experience deeply tied to how his senses worked.

As Aayush and I continued our conversation, he opened up more about his challenges with food. **“It’s not that I don’t want to try new things,”** he explained, **“but certain flavors feel so overpowering they make me gag. Sometimes even thinking about strong tastes makes me anxious.”**

He pointed to the untouched toast on his plate. **"Plain toast is usually a safe choice,"** he said, **"but even that can be tricky depending on how it’s prepared. I know it sounds strange, but some textures, like mushy or grainy foods, make me feel uncomfortable. It’s like my mouth rejects them.”**

## The Social Side of Taste Sensitivity

Aayush shared that eating out or attending social gatherings could be challenging. **“When I’m around family or friends, it feels like I’m always having to explain myself. People sometimes think I’m just picky or being difficult,”** he said with a sigh. **“They don’t realize it’s not a choice—it’s just how my body reacts.”**

At weddings or large gatherings, Aayush often finds himself quietly avoiding certain dishes or looking for plain options. He mentioned feeling a mix of embarrassment and frustration when people encourage him to **“just try a little”** or say things like, **“Come on, it’s not that bad.”** **“They mean well, but it can feel exhausting having to defend myself over something as simple as food,”** he admitted.

## How Aayush Manages Taste Sensitivity

Over the years, Aayush has developed ways to navigate his taste sensitivity. He shared a few of his personal strategies with me, like carrying snacks he knows he can tolerate. **“If I know I'll be in a place with foods that are difficult for me, I make sure to bring along something I can eat, like basic crackers or dried fruit.”**

Aayush has also learned to communicate his needs in a way that feels comfortable. He said he’s now open about his preferences with close friends, who understand and don’t pressure him to eat things that make him uncomfortable. **“It really helps to be surrounded by people who just get it.”** he said.

## A Better Understanding of Sensory Sensitivity

Talking to Aayush gave me a new perspective on the world of taste sensitivity. It’s not about fussiness; it’s about physical and sensory reactions that are as real as any other sensitivity. And just as we wouldn’t ask someone to walk through a thorn bush barefoot, we shouldn’t expect someone with taste sensitivity to endure foods that feel overwhelming.

## Final Thoughts

Leaving the café that day, I felt grateful for the chance to see food from Aayush’s perspective. It reminded me of how vital it is to approach each person’s experiences with compassion and understanding. For those of us who may not understand taste sensitivity firsthand, offering patience, a non-judgmental attitude, and maybe a few safe food options can go a long way in making social situations more comfortable for someone like Aayush.
