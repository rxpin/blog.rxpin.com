While the introduction of ICD-11 marks an important step in redefining how autism is diagnosed, understood, and supported, its impact varies significantly across the world. The truth is, not every country is able to implement these changes at the same pace—or with the same resources. This creates a gap, one that can affect the lives of autistic individuals and their families in very real ways.

## A Global Standard That’s Not Yet Global

ICD-11 was officially released by the World Health Organization in 2018 and came into effect in January 2022. It’s meant to be a universal classification system, offering countries a modern, unified language for understanding health conditions—including autism.

But transitioning from ICD-10 to ICD-11 is not as simple as flipping a switch. It requires:

- New training for health professionals
- Updates to national health systems and software
- Public awareness campaigns
- Policy changes that align services with the new framework

For high-income countries with well-funded healthcare systems, these transitions, while still complex, are more achievable. But in low- and middle-income countries, the challenges are far greater.

## Where Does This Leave Us?

In many parts of the world—including regions across South Asia, Africa, and Latin America—ICD-10 is still widely used. In some cases, outdated or mixed systems are in place, making diagnosis inconsistent. This has consequences:

- Delayed or missed diagnoses
- Lack of appropriate support for children and adults on the spectrum
- Inaccurate national data, which affects funding and policy decisions
- Families left confused, navigating systems that don’t reflect current understanding

This uneven pace of implementation contributes to a global divide in autism care and awareness. While one part of the world moves forward with inclusive language and person-centered approaches, another may still be operating with outdated definitions that don't reflect the spectrum or the real needs of autistic individuals.

## A Closer Look: Challenges in Nepal and Similar Settings

Take Nepal, for example. While awareness about autism has grown in recent years, especially in urban areas, diagnostic frameworks are still catching up. Many professionals are more familiar with ICD-10, and support services remain limited outside major cities. Parents often face long waits, unclear diagnoses, or must travel far just to find someone trained in autism assessment.

The shift to ICD-11 could change this—but only if there’s investment in training, public education, and inclusive healthcare policies. Without these, the newer, better definition of autism may remain just words on paper.

## Building Bridges, Not Gaps

To close this divide, we need global collaboration. Governments, NGOs, medical institutions, and autism advocates must work together to:

- Provide accessible training on ICD-11
- Translate diagnostic tools into local languages
- Fund research and support programs in underserved areas
- Listen to autistic voices across different cultures and communities

## A Hopeful Path Forward

ICD-11 offers a more accurate, compassionate, and unified view of autism. But it can only fulfill its promise if it reaches every corner of the world. Because no child should be left undiagnosed. No adult should be misunderstood. And no family should feel alone in their search for answers.

The evolution of autism in the ICD isn’t just about diagnosis—it’s about dignity, equity, and creating a world where everyone, no matter where they live, has a chance to be seen, supported, and valued.
