## Did you know that 1 in 7 people worldwide are neurodivergent, yet in Nepal, many of these individuals remain hidden, not because they want to___ but because society still struggles to understand and accept them?  

**So, what does that mean? Neurodivergence is all about the natural variations in how brains function.**  

It's things like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and more—conditions that often make people see the world in a unique way.

But why is it that in Nepal, these differences are misunderstood, while in other parts of the world, they’re starting to be celebrated as just another form of human diversity?  
> **What’s holding us back from embracing this richness?**  
<br>

Globally, the idea of neurodiversity is gaining momentum, with more people recognizing that these differences are not flaws, but unique strengths. Yet, in Nepal, cultural stigma, a lack of awareness, and deeply rooted misconceptions continue to foster discrimination and exclusion for neurodivergent individuals.  

**So, what’s the real barrier to change here?** 

In many parts of Nepal, neurodivergent children are often labeled as 'problematic,' and, as a result, excluded from schools. Their parents are blamed for their condition, accused of bad karma or improper parenting.  
This mindset creates a toxic cycle of ignorance, isolation, and misunderstanding, making it even harder for these individuals to thrive in society.

**What’s behind this? The root cause lies in:**  
- A severe lack of education about neurodiversity  
- Deeply ingrained cultural and religious misconceptions  
- Insufficient government policies and resources to support neurodivergent individuals  
***

**But here's the truth:** Change is possible. By raising awareness, educating our communities, and advocating for stronger policies, we can shift the narrative. We can create a society where neurodivergent individuals aren’t just tolerated, but truly celebrated for who they are. A society where every person’s potential can flourish is within reach—if we unite in this mission.  

> **So, why do we continue to associate neurodivergence with shame, misfortune, or weakness in Nepal, when globally, it’s being recognized and embraced as a form of diversity?**  

**What are we waiting for to change our perspective?**
