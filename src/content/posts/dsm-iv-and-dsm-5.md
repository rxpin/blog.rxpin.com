The way autism is diagnosed has changed over time, with the shift from DSM-IV to DSM-5 being one of the most significant updates. These revisions have influenced how autism is understood, diagnosed, and treated.

# Autism in DSM-IV
Prior to 2013, the DSM-IV classified autism under a broader category known as Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), which included:
- Autistic Disorder
- Asperger’s Disorder
- Pervasive Developmental Disorder – Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS)
- Rett Syndrome
- Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD)

These separate categories sometimes led to confusion and inconsistency in diagnosis. The differences between Autistic Disorder and Asperger’s Syndrome, for instance, were not always clear-cut. Additionally, PDD-NOS often became a default diagnosis for individuals who did not fit neatly into the other categories.

## The Transition to DSM-5
In 2013, the DSM-5 introduced a more unified approach to autism diagnosis. Instead of multiple subcategories, all previous types of autism were grouped under a single term: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The key changes included:

- **Merging of Subtypes** – The individual diagnoses of Autistic Disorder, Asperger’s Syndrome, and PDD-NOS were consolidated under ASD.
- **Two Primary Diagnostic Domains** – The DSM-IV criteria were split into three areas: social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. DSM-5 combined social interaction and communication into one category, resulting in two main criteria:
  - Deficits in social communication and interaction.
  - Restricted, repetitive behaviors and interests.
- **Inclusion of Sensory Sensitivities** – The DSM-5 officially acknowledged sensory processing differences as part of autism traits.
- **Severity Levels Introduced** – ASD diagnoses now include three severity levels based on the level of support needed:
  - Level 1: Requires support
  - Level 2: Requires substantial support
  - Level 3: Requires very substantial support
- **Introduction of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SCD)** – Individuals with social communication challenges who do not exhibit repetitive behaviors are now categorized separately under SCD rather than ASD.

# Effects of DSM-5 Changes
The transition to DSM-5 was met with a range of reactions. On one hand, combining all autism-related diagnoses into ASD provided a more standardized understanding of autism. This has helped reduce inconsistencies and improve research approaches.

On the other hand, some individuals previously diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome or PDD-NOS felt their identities were disregarded. Others worried that the new criteria might exclude some individuals who previously qualified for an autism diagnosis, potentially affecting their access to support services.

Additionally, the introduction of severity levels has been debated, as autism traits can vary over time and in different environments. Some argue that fixed severity levels do not always reflect the fluid nature of support needs.

# Future Considerations
The DSM-5 brought substantial updates to autism diagnosis, but discussions continue on how best to define and assess autism. As understanding grows and the neurodiversity movement gains traction, future revisions may refine how autism is classified to better reflect the diversity of autistic experiences.
