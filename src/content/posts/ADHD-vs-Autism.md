# ADHD vs. Autism - What’s the Difference?

## Introduction
Sensory overload is a struggle for many neurodivergent individuals, but it doesn’t manifest the same way in everyone. Both autism (ASD) and ADHD involve sensory processing differences, yet the way each condition interacts with sensory input can be vastly different. Understanding these differences is key to recognizing challenges, offering support, and finding strategies that actually work.

## Sensory Processing in Autism vs. ADHD
Sensory processing is the way the brain detects, interprets, and reacts to sensory input from the environment. While both autistic and ADHD brains can have heightened or diminished sensory responses, the way they react and cope often differs.

### Sensory Feature Comparison
| Sensory Feature     | Autism (ASD) | ADHD |
|--------------------|-------------|------|
| **Hypersensitivity** | Overwhelmed by loud noises, bright lights, strong smells; may shut down or seek quiet spaces | Easily distracted by sensory stimuli but may not always find it distressing |
| **Hyposensitivity** | May not notice pain, temperature changes, or other sensory inputs | Can seek intense sensory stimulation (e.g., loud music, movement) |
| **Response to Overload** | May experience meltdowns or shutdowns when overwhelmed | Restlessness, fidgeting, or frustration when overstimulated |
| **Sensory Seeking** | May enjoy repetitive motions, deep pressure, or specific textures | Often craves novelty and fast-paced, high-intensity experiences |
| **Coping Mechanisms** | Uses routines, avoids triggering environments, relies on specific textures or sounds for comfort | Moves around, changes tasks frequently, engages in stimming-like behaviors (but often unconsciously) |

## How Sensory Overload Feels for Each Condition
While sensory overload is common in both autism and ADHD, it can feel very different:

- **For an autistic person**, sensory overload can feel like a complete system shutdown. Bright lights may be painful, loud noises unbearable, and too much input at once can lead to extreme distress, a meltdown, or a shutdown.
- **For someone with ADHD**, sensory overload often feels like an unfiltered barrage of distractions. Too many competing sounds, textures, or movements can make it hard to focus, leading to frustration, impulsivity, or an urgent need to move away.

## Misconceptions About Sensory Overload in ADHD and Autism
- **“Only autistic people struggle with sensory overload.”** → ADHD brains can also struggle with sensory overwhelm, but they may react differently (e.g., fidgeting instead of shutting down).
- **“People with ADHD can’t be hypersensitive.”** → Many individuals with ADHD are sensitive to noise, touch, or light but experience it in a more distractible or irritable way rather than complete overwhelm.
- **“Stimming is only an autism trait.”** → ADHDers also engage in stimming (leg bouncing, tapping, doodling) to regulate sensory input, even if it’s not as structured as in autism.

## How to Manage Sensory Overload
Since sensory overload impacts both conditions but in different ways, the management strategies need to be personalized:

### For autism:
- Use noise-canceling headphones or tinted glasses
- Stick to predictable routines
- Find soothing sensory experiences (weighted blankets, deep pressure, preferred textures)
- Create a quiet, controlled environment

### For ADHD:
- Allow for movement and sensory breaks
- Use fidget tools or background noise to regulate focus
- Experiment with different sensory inputs to find what helps (chewing gum, standing desks, stress balls)
- Reduce unnecessary stimuli in work or study environments

## Final Thoughts
Both ADHD and autism involve sensory processing differences, but they impact individuals in unique ways. Recognizing these distinctions can lead to better understanding, improved accommodations, and more effective coping strategies. Sensory overload isn’t just about what’s happening around a person—it’s about how their brain processes and responds to it. By embracing neurodiversity, we can create spaces that support both autistic and ADHD individuals in navigating a sensory-rich world.
