Disability has often been seen as a problem to fix. For decades, society has measured individuals against a narrow definition of what is “normal” in movement, speech, learning, communication, and behavior. Anyone who falls outside this frame is labeled as having a deficit, as if their value is reduced by their differences.

But that view is outdated and harmful. **Disability is not a deficit.** And **neurodivergence**, including conditions like autism or ADHD, is not something to be corrected. These are natural variations of the human brain. Understanding this shift in perspective is not just helpful; it’s necessary.

## The Problem With the Deficit Model

Historically, disability has been viewed through the **medical model**. This approach focuses on what an individual cannot do. A child who doesn’t speak by a certain age, a student who struggles with reading, or a worker who needs extra time to complete tasks are all seen as lacking something essential. The problem is placed inside the person.

The model overlooks how environments and expectations are often designed for a narrow type of mind or body. It fails to ask whether the school, the workplace, or the community is prepared to support different needs and assumes that being disabled means being less.

This deficit-based view has led to **stigma**, **exclusion**, and **internalized shame**. It pushes people to hide their differences, often leading to barriers that limit us from understanding them.

## Understanding Neurodivergence as Human Diversity

The brain is the most complex and largest network there is. Through these networks, also known as **Brain Network**, different parts of brains get activated and perform certain tasks.  
**Fun fact?** The Brain Network is active even during sleep!

The **neurotypical** brain approaches a task by following a specific method to achieve a particular outcome. However, not always the network operates as expected. Sometimes the flow of neurons, data of the brain, is wired to take a different path.

**Neurodiversity** is the idea that certain neurological differences present in a human body change the way they perceive, communicate and experience the world. These differences like ADHD, Autism, Alexia are the normal variation in the human genome. However, it does not mean that they are incapable of doing these; expressing and experiencing. It’s just that they do it differently.

> For instance, you can ask yourself:  
> **How do you reach your regular grocery store?**  
> Following your usual route is neurotypical, and taking a new one is neurodivergent.  

Being neurodivergent is not having disease or faults. They are part of **natural human diversity** and it simply is different, nothing more.

The **neurodiversity paradigm** helps explain this idea. It recognizes that people are born with different cognitive profiles, and those differences are neither better nor worse. They are simply different. Just as there are many ways to move through the world physically, there are also many valid ways to think, learn, and feel.

**Autism**, for example, is not a condition that needs to be “fixed.” Autistic people may communicate differently, process sensory information in unique ways, or have intense focus on specific interests. These traits come with challenges, but they also bring **insight**, **honesty**, **attention to detail**, and **creativity**. These are not deficits; they are characteristics of a different neurotype.

> *“Neurodiversity is my superpower and I proudly navigate life by my own rules and routines. Most people can’t even imagine the wonderful way I view the world.”*

## The Role of Environment and Society

When a plant doesn’t thrive, we look at the soil, the light, the water. **We don’t blame the plant.**  
Yet when a person struggles, society often blames the individual.  
The truth is, many difficulties that neurodivergent people face are not because of their minds, but because the **world around them is not built for them**.

Schools that only value verbal participation, workplaces that punish lateness without asking why, and cultures that insist on eye contact and small talk can all become **hostile environments** for neurodivergent people. These environments don’t fail because people are disabled. They fail because they **lack flexibility and understanding**.

Recognizing disability as a **mismatch between the person and their environment** changes everything. It shifts responsibility from the individual to the system, asking what adjustments can be made so everyone can thrive.

## A Local Context: What Neurodivergence Looks Like in Nepal

In Nepal, awareness around autism and neurodivergence is growing, but **stigma and misinformation** are still common. Many families feel isolated or ashamed when their child doesn’t behave in typical ways. Diagnoses can be hard to access, and when they are given, they often come with a long list of **deficits and labels**.

Yet progress is happening. Organizations are beginning to offer **inclusive education**, and more teachers are learning how to support different learning styles.

For example:
- **Visual learning tools**
- **Sensory-friendly classrooms**
- **Interest-based learning**

These are being introduced in some schools to support autistic children. These small changes make a **significant difference**.

When children are **understood and supported** and not judged or forced to mask their differences, they can succeed in ways that reflect who they are. And that success benefits **everyone**.

## Supporting Neurodivergence Without Forcing Change

Supporting neurodivergent individuals does not mean **forcing them to become more typical**.  
It means giving them the **space and tools** to navigate the world in their own way. That includes:

- Providing **alternative ways** to learn and communicate  
- Reducing **sensory overload** in classrooms and workplaces  
- Allowing for **breaks, flexible routines, and quiet spaces**  
- Respecting **direct communication styles** without misjudging them as rude  
- Avoiding language that **defines people by what they lack**

It also means **asking individuals how they describe themselves**.  
Some may prefer identity-first language, like “autistic person,” while others may use person-first terms.  
**Listening and respecting these preferences is a basic form of dignity.**

## Moving Forward With Respect and Responsibility

**Neurodivergence is not something to fear, pity, or fix.**  
It is something to **understand**, **support**, and **value**.

When we stop seeing disability as a deficit, we begin to see the **full potential in every person**.

Change begins with how we **speak**, how we **teach**, how we **hire**, and how we **treat** those who think and feel differently.  
It begins with **letting go of the idea that there is only one right way to be human**.

> “Neurodiversity is the future of innovation and progress.”  
> — *Steve Silberman*

Every individual deserves a world that **adapts to them**, not one that asks them to constantly adapt to survive.

This is what it means to say **disability is not a deficit**.  
It is a statement of **truth**, **dignity**, and **hope** for a better future for everyone.
