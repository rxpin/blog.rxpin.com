Nepal is failing its autistic community. While many believe that Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is the gold standard for autism therapy, the way it's conducted in Nepal is nothing more than a watered-down, ineffective version of what ABA is truly meant to be. Compared to international standards, Nepal’s ABA is more of a business model than a real intervention. And it’s time we talk about it.

## ABA in Nepal vs. the Rest of the World: A Stark Difference

In countries like the United States, Australia, Canada, and the UK, ABA is a structured, intensive, and research-backed intervention that involves:

- ✅ 20-40 hours of therapy per week, not just a one-hour session.
- ✅ Highly trained and certified ABA therapists who specialize in autism intervention.
- ✅ Parental involvement, ensuring therapy extends beyond the clinic and into daily life.
- ✅ Individualized programs, tailored to each child’s specific needs.
- ✅ Data-driven progress tracking, adjusting strategies as needed.

Now, let’s look at how ABA is conducted in Nepal:

- ❌ 1-hour therapy sessions that barely scratch the surface of what ABA is supposed to be.
- ❌ No intensity—autistic children need structured intervention, but what they get is random, inconsistent sessions.
- ❌ Limited or no parental training, leaving families unaware of how to continue therapy at home.
- ❌ A shortage of certified professionals, leading to unqualified therapists using ABA as a buzzword.
- ❌ A therapy-room-only approach, with little effort to apply skills in real-life settings.

## The Illusion of ABA in Nepal: A System That’s Failing Autistic Individuals

Many Nepali parents are led to believe that ABA is everything—that sending their child to a one-hour session will magically "fix" them. But the harsh reality is that this approach is doing almost nothing to help autistic children build real-world skills.

In reality, real ABA is a lifestyle, not just therapy. It is about:

- ✔ Teaching children functional life skills, not just getting them to follow commands in a therapy room.
- ✔ Empowering parents to be co-therapists so progress happens at home too.
- ✔ Focusing on long-term development, not just short-term compliance.

But in Nepal, ABA has turned into a business model rather than a true intervention. Therapy centers charge high fees for ineffective sessions, and parents, unaware of what real ABA should look like, continue to pay—hoping for results that may never come.

## The Way Forward: Nepal Needs a Revolution in Autism Therapy

If Nepal truly cares about its autistic community, we must change how ABA is implemented. Here’s what needs to happen:

- 🔥 Stop glorifying ineffective ABA—one-hour therapy isn’t enough! Parents need to demand real, intensive intervention.
- 🔥 Push for better training for therapists—certification and real expertise should be the norm, not the exception.
- 🔥 Educate parents so they know what real ABA looks like and how to continue therapy at home.
- 🔥 Focus on real-life applications—teaching children skills that help them function in society.
- 🔥 Shift the mindset—ABA should not be about "fixing" autism but about supporting autistic individuals to live meaningful lives.

## Final Words: Wake Up, Nepal!

Nepal needs to stop pretending that it's offering world-class ABA when, in reality, it’s barely meeting the minimum standards. Until we acknowledge this truth, autistic children will continue to suffer, and parents will continue to be misled.

It’s time for a real change. Not for the sake of therapy centers, but for the autistic individuals who deserve better.
