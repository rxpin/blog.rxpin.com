## Introduction  
In the first part of this blog, we explored the evolution of autism within the ICD. But the journey doesn’t end there! Now, let’s look at how the ICD is shaping the future of autism diagnosis and treatment, and what improvements could still be made to better support individuals on the autism spectrum.

## How the ICD Impacts Our Understanding of Autism  
The ICD’s influence on autism goes far beyond just diagnosis—it plays a major role in changing how we perceive and treat autism in society.

### Breaking the Stigma  
Thanks to the ICD’s inclusion of autism under a flexible spectrum, we’re starting to see a shift in how society views autism. Instead of focusing on deficits, we’re learning to appreciate the unique strengths and perspectives of individuals with autism.

### Empowering Advocates  
With the ICD-11 providing a clearer, more inclusive framework, advocates now have a stronger foundation to push for better policies, services, and awareness for the autism community.

## Challenges Ahead: Can the ICD Do More?  
Even with all its progress, the ICD still has room for improvement. Here are a few areas where we could make changes:

### The Complexity of Autism  
Autism is incredibly diverse, and while the ICD-11 is a step forward, it can’t capture every nuance. Could we expand the classification to include a broader spectrum of experiences, including non-verbal individuals or those who don’t fit traditional diagnostic criteria?

### Access Disparities  
In some regions, the ICD’s guidelines may not be fully implemented or understood, meaning individuals with autism might still struggle to access the services they need. What can we do to ensure consistency and equity across different countries?

### Future Evolution  
The future of the ICD could be even more promising. Imagine a tool that not only helps doctors diagnose autism but also provides detailed data to help them deliver personalized care. The possibilities are endless.

## Conclusion: A More Inclusive Future for Autism  
From a time when autism was misunderstood and misclassified, the ICD has come a long way in how it helps us diagnose, treat, and understand autism. While there’s still work to be done, the ICD-11 has created a much-needed shift in how autism is viewed. As we continue to improve this system, we’ll move toward a more inclusive future for individuals with autism.
